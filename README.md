This contains the Rmd script and files necessary to perform analyses for the Landscapes of missense variant impact for human superoxide dismutase 1 manuscript. 

Pymol files are also included used to generate Figures 2 (quadrant_painted.pse) and Figure S9 (abundance_painted.pse and activity_painted.pse). Please note the pdb files are off by one amino acid (using the classic SOD1 notation, e.g. A4 instead of A5).
